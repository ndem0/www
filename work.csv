Research Fellow;since 2017;SISSA, Trieste;Within the Project HEaD by European Social Found, I work as researcher at SISSA MathLab to work on shape optimization using the model reduction;
Internship;2016;Fincantieri, Trieste;During the MHPC thesis, I worked as HPC specialist to build an efficient pipeline for the naval bulb shape optimization, coupling an automated freeform deformation, a finite volume solver and the model reduction.
