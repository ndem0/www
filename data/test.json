Applications must then exploit both directions of parallelism to run efficiently. In this work we focus on the efficient use of vector instructions. These process several data-elements in parallel, and memory data layout plays an important role to make this efficient. An optimal memory-layout depends in principle on the access patterns of the algorithm but also on the architectural features of the processor. However, different parts of the application may have different requirements, and then the choice of the most efficient data-structure for vectorization has to be carefully assessed. We address these problems for a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) code, widely used in computational fluid-dynamics. We consider a state-of-the-art two-dimensional LB model, that accurately reproduces the thermo-hydrodynamics of a 2D-fluid. We write our codes in C and expose vector parallelism using directive-based programming approach. We consider different data layouts and analyze the corresponding performance. Our results show that, if an appropriate data layout is selected, it is possible to write a code for this class of applications that is automatically vectorized and performance portable on several architectures. We end up with a single code that runs efficiently onto traditional multi-core processors as well as on recent many-core systems such as the Xeon-Phi.", "year": "2016", "pages": "53--62"}, {"author": "Demo, Nicola and Tezzele, Marco and Mola, Andrea and Rozza, Gianluigi", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "booktitle": "The 28th International Ocean and Polar Engineering Conference", "bibitem": "DemoTezzeleMolaRozza2018ISOPE", "eprint": "1801.06369", "year": "2018", "abstract": "In this contribution"}, {"Publisher": "ECCOMAS", "Author": "Gianluigi Rozza and Muhammad Haris Malik and Nicola Demo and Marco Tezzele and Michele Girfoglio and Giovanni Stabile and Andrea Mola", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "Booktitle": "Proceedings of the ECCOMAS Congress 2018", "Title": "Advances in Reduced Order Methods for Parametric Industrial Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics", "bibitem": "RozzaMalikDemoTezzeleGirfoglioStabileMola2018ECCOMAS", "eprint": "1811.08319", "Location": "Glasgow, UK", "Year": "2018", "Organization": "ECCOMAS"}, {"publisher": "Elsevier BV", "doi": "10.1016/j.crme.2019.11.012", "number": "11", "author": "Nicola Demo and Marco Tezzele and Gianluigi Rozza", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crme.2019.11.012", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "journal": "Comptes Rendus M\\'ecanique", "bibitem": "DemoTezzeleRozza2019CRM", "month": "nov", "volume": "347", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprint": "1907.12777", "year": "2019", "pages": "873--881"}, {"eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "booktitle": "Novel mathematics inspired by industrial challenges [in press]", "bibitem": "TezzeleDemoMolaRozza2018"}, {"title": "Shape optimization through proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation and dynamic mode decomposition enhanced by active subspaces", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "booktitle": "VIII International Conference on Computational Methods in Marine Engineering", "author": "Tezzele, Marco and Demo, Nicola and Rozza, Gianluigi", "bibitem": "TezzeleDemoRozza2019MARINE", "eprint": "1905.05483", "year": "2019", "abstract": "We propose a numerical pipeline for shape optimization in naval engineering involving two different non-intrusive reduced order method (ROM) techniques. Such methods are proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation (PODI) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). The ROM proposed will be enhanced by active subspaces (AS) as a pre-processing tool that reduce the parameter space dimension and suggest better sampling of the input space. We will focus on geometrical parameters describing the perturbation of a reference bulbous bow through the free form deformation (FFD) technique. The ROM are based on a finite volume method (FV) to simulate the multi-phase incompressible flow around the deformed hulls. In previous works we studied the reduction of the parameter space in naval engineering through AS [38, 10] focusing on different parts of the hull. PODI and DMD have been employed for the study of fast and reliable shape optimization cycles on a bulbous bow in [9]. The novelty of this work is the simultaneous reduction of both the input parameter space and the output fields of interest. In particular AS will be trained computing the total drag resistance of a hull advancing in calm water and its gradients with respect to the input parameters. DMD will improve the performance of each simulation of the campaign using only few snapshots of the solution fields in order to predict the regime state of the system. Finally PODI will interpolate the coefficients of the POD decomposition of the output fields for a fast approximation of all the fields at new untried parameters given by the optimization algorithm. This will result in a non-intrusive data-driven numerical optimization pipeline completely independent with respect to the full order solver used and it can be easily incorporated into existing numerical pipelines"}, {"publisher": "The Open Journal", "doi": "10.21105/joss.00661", "number": "24", "author": "Nicola Demo and Marco Tezzele and Gianluigi Rozza", "url": "https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00661", "title": "EZyRB: Easy Reduced Basis method", "bibitem": "DemoTezzeleRozza2018EZyRB", "month": "apr", "volume": "3", "year": "2018", "pages": "661"}, {"eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "bibitem": "GarottaDemoTezzeleCarraturoRealiRozza2018"}, {"title": "A complete data-driven framework for the efficient solution of parametric shape design and optimisation in naval engineering problems", "eprinttype": "arXiv", "eprintclass": "math.NA", "booktitle": "VIII International Conference on Computational Methods in Marine Engineering", "author": "Demo, Nicola and Tezzele, Marco and Mola, Andrea and Rozza, Gianluigi", "bibitem": "DemoTezzeleMolaRozza2019MARINE", "eprint": "1905.05982", "year": "2019", "abstract": "In the reduced order modeling (ROM) framework, the solution of a parametric partial differential equation is approximated by combining the high-fidelity solutions of the problem at hand for several properly chosen configurations. Examples of the ROM application, in the naval field, can be found in [31, 24]. Mandatory ingredient for the ROM methods is the relation between the high-fidelity solutions and the parameters. Dealing with geometrical parameters, especially in the industrial context, this relation may be unknown and not trivial (simulations over hand morphed geometries) or very complex (high number of parameters or many nested morphing techniques). To overcome these scenarios, we propose in this contribution an efficient and complete data-driven framework involving ROM techniques for shape design and optimization, extending the pipeline presented in [7]. By applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) to the points coordinates defining the hull geometry --- assuming the topology is inaltered by the deformation ---, we are able to compute the optimal space which the deformed geometries belong to, hence using the modal coefficients as the new parameters we can reconstruct the parametric formulation of the domain. Finally the output of interest is approximated using the proper orthogonal decomposition with interpolation technique. To conclude"}]
